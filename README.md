# DHCPCord
Discord bot to assign IP addresses to users bc memes.

# What???

DCHPCord attempts to implement networking protocols within Discord such as TCP and ARP, with UDP on the way.
Features: 
IP addresses. Every user gets one! Guilds get different subnets, with external IP routing coming soon!
MAC addresses: every user and bot has a MAC address, just in case you suspect someoneâ€™s identity.
Sockets (soon): create services like web servers and chat channels.
Networking themed mod commands: kick, ban and mute using IP, MAC, or good old user ID
